# Access Control Web Lab (ACWL)
Access Control Web Lab (ACWL) is a web-based application designed for practice and in-depth understanding of access control vulnerabilities. This lab draws on the article “JavaScript Analysis: Identifying and Exploiting Web Weaknesses”, which focuses on access control vulnerabilities in web applications.

## Getting Started

```

By default, the application runs on http://localhost:5000. You can access it from your web browser to start exploring vulnerabilities.
### Default Credentials
You can log in using the following credentials:
```
Email: john@local.app
Password: passwd123 
```
> Note: These credentials are for demo purposes.
